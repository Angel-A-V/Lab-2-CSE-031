Individual Assignment 1: Segmentation Faults
    
    1. The line that caused the segmentation fault was line 24: scanf("%d", input).

    2. To fix this line, you need to pass the value by its address, like this: scanf("%d", &input). 
       This is because scanf expects a pointer to store the input value, not the variable itself.

    3. There is also an issue with the average calculation because sum is being passed by value, meaning changes 
        to sum inside read_values do not reflect in the main function.

    4. To fix this, modify read_values so that sum is passed by reference. This requires using a pointer in 
       read_values, and then in main, pass sum by reference.
