Individual Assignment 1: Segmentation Faults
    
    1. The line that caused the segmentation fault was line 24: scanf("%d", input).

    2. To fix this line, you need to pass the value by its address, like this: scanf("%d", &input). 
       This is because scanf expects a pointer to store the input value, not the variable itself.

    3. There is also an issue with the average calculation because sum is being passed by value, meaning changes 
        to sum inside read_values do not reflect in the main function.

    4. To fix this, modify read_values so that sum is passed by reference. This requires using a pointer in 
       read_values, and then in main, pass sum by reference.
    
Individual Assignment 2: Complete arrCopy.c

    1. No the output wasn't expected, I was expecting "HELLO!hello!" instead we have random characters at the end
       of the print statement.
    
    2. The output again is not expected and it has something to do with a missing null terminator at the end of the 
       concatenarted string , causing those garbage characters to print out as well.
    
    3. The output is not expected as were assume it should be able to print the whole statement we typed into terminal.
       But while looking at the code I can see that it has to do with the fixed character values for str1 and str2 at 10 characters.
